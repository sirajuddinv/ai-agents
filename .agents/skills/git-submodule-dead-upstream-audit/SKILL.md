# Git Submodule Dead Upstream Audit Skill (v1)

This skill provides a deterministic, evidence-based protocol for auditing a Git submodule whose upstream URL appears
to be unreachable. It answers three questions in order — **(1) Is the upstream really gone?** **(2) Do we have any
local copy of its history?** **(3) Does any public fork or mirror still hold the recorded commit SHA?** — so the
agent can recommend removal, re-pointing, or recovery on the basis of evidence rather than assumption.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This skill is **non-destructive**. It produces an audit verdict only. Removal MUST be performed by the
> [`git-submodule-removal`](../git-submodule-removal/SKILL.md) skill, and re-pointing MUST be performed by
> [`git-submodule-fork-reconfigure`](../git-submodule-fork-reconfigure/SKILL.md), each with explicit user authorization.

***

## 1. Environment & Dependencies

Before execution, the agent MUST verify each tool. Missing tools MUST be installed via the
[`system-wide-tool-management`](../system-wide-tool-management/SKILL.md) skill.

- **git**: Submodule introspection.
    - Check: `which git && git --version`
- **curl**: Upstream reachability and authenticated GitHub API queries. The `curl` invocations in §2 follow the
  same canonical pattern documented in [GitHub REST API Fallback](../github-rest-api-fallback/SKILL.md) §2.4
  (mandatory `User-Agent` header, `-fsSL` flags, PAT via `$GITHUB_TOKEN` env var) — that skill is the SSOT for
  GitHub REST invocations and SHOULD be consulted when adapting any call here.
    - Check: `which curl && curl --version`
- **PowerShell alternative**: On Windows without `curl`, every call below can be rewritten with
  `Invoke-RestMethod` per [GitHub REST API Fallback](../github-rest-api-fallback/SKILL.md) §2.1.
- **python3**: JSON parsing for GitHub API responses.
    - Check: `which python3 && python3 --version`
- **PAGER Environment**: Export `PAGER=cat` for all Git commands to prevent terminal hangs.
- **No direct-shell tool**: When `run_in_terminal` is unavailable, route every shell invocation through
  [Terminal Fallback via VS Code Tasks](../terminal-fallback-via-vscode-tasks/SKILL.md) §3.

### 1.1 GitHub Token (Required for Code Search)

The unauthenticated GitHub API rejects code search with HTTP 401. The agent MUST resolve a personal access token
**without printing it to the terminal**:

```bash
GH_TOKEN=$(awk '$1=="GitHub"{print $2; exit}' "<KEYS_FILE>")
```

- `<KEYS_FILE>`: A space-separated `keyword value` file under the user's private configuration directory (the agent
  MUST ask the user for the path; it is **never** committed or echoed).
- The agent MUST verify only the prefix (e.g., `printf '%s' "$GH_TOKEN" | head -c 8`) to confirm the token loaded —
  full-value echo is **FORBIDDEN**.

***

## 2. Pre-Audit Discovery

1. **Read the submodule registration**:

    ```bash
    PAGER=cat git config --file .gitmodules --get-regexp "^submodule\.<PATH>\."
    ```

    Extract the configured `url` and any `branch`.

2. **Resolve the recorded pointer SHA** from the parent index:

    ```bash
    PAGER=cat git ls-tree HEAD <PATH> | awk '{print $3}'
    ```

    The output is a 40-character commit SHA (the "recorded pointer").

3. **Inspect the working tree state**:

    ```bash
    ls -la <PATH> 2>&1 | head
    ls -la .git/modules/<PATH> 2>&1 | head
    ```

    - **Empty `<PATH>` directory + missing `.git/modules/<PATH>`** ⇒ submodule was never initialized; **no local
      history exists**.
    - **Populated `.git/modules/<PATH>`** ⇒ a local clone exists; the recorded SHA may be recoverable from local
      objects via `git -C .git/modules/<PATH> cat-file -t <SHA>`.

***

## 3. Upstream Reachability Probe

Run both an HTML and an API probe; treat any **2xx** as alive, **3xx** as renamed/moved (follow it), **404/410** as
deleted, and **private** as inaccessible (the API returns `404` for private repos to anonymous callers).

```bash
# HTML probe (no auth required)
curl -sI "<URL_WITHOUT_DOT_GIT>" | head -3

# API probe (authenticated — distinguishes private vs deleted only with the right token scope)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $GH_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
    "https://api.github.com/repos/<OWNER>/<REPO>" | python3 -c "import sys,json;d=json.load(sys.stdin);print(d.get('message') or d.get('full_name'))"
```

- **Pedagogical Breakdown**:
    - `curl -sI`: silent, headers-only — fast 404 detection without downloading the body.
    - `Authorization: Bearer $GH_TOKEN`: required for any API call beyond 60 req/h and for code search.
    - `Accept: application/vnd.github+json`: pins the API media type for forward-compatibility.
    - The `python3` filter prints either `Not Found` (deleted) or the canonical `full_name` (alive, possibly renamed).

***

## 4. Fork / Mirror Discovery (Authenticated)

When the upstream is gone, search public GitHub for any surviving copy of the recorded SHA. Each query MUST be
authenticated.

### 4.1 SHA Code Search (Strongest Signal)

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $GH_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
    "https://api.github.com/search/code?q=<RECORDED_SHA>" \
    | python3 -c "import sys,json;d=json.load(sys.stdin);print('total:',d.get('total_count'));[print(i['repository']['full_name'],i['path']) for i in d.get('items',[])[:20]]"
```

A non-zero `total_count` means at least one repository commits a file containing that exact SHA — usually a
submodule pointer in another super-project that still references the dead submodule. Each hit is a candidate mirror.

### 4.2 Repository Name Search

```bash
for q in "<OWNER>+<REPO>" "<REPO>+user:<OWNER>" "<REPO>+fork:true"; do
    echo "=== $q ==="
    curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $GH_TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
        "https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=$q" \
        | python3 -c "import sys,json;d=json.load(sys.stdin);print('total:',d.get('total_count'));[print('-',i['full_name']) for i in d.get('items',[])[:10]]"
done
```

### 4.3 Owner Activity Sweep

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $GH_TOKEN" \
    "https://api.github.com/users/<OWNER>/repos?per_page=100" \
    | python3 -c "import sys,json;[print(r['full_name']) for r in json.load(sys.stdin)]"

curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $GH_TOKEN" \
    "https://api.github.com/users/<OWNER>/events?per_page=100" \
    | python3 -c "import sys,json;print('\n'.join(sorted({e['repo']['name'] for e in json.load(sys.stdin)})))"
```

This catches renames (e.g., `<REPO>` → `<REPO>-archive`) and reveals related repos that may host a salvage branch.

### 4.4 Wayback Machine (Last-Resort)

```bash
curl -s "https://archive.org/wayback/available?url=github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>" \
    | python3 -c "import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('archived_snapshots') or 'no snapshot')"
```

A snapshot only proves the repo *existed*, not that the SHA can be recovered, but it can yield the original
README and identify the project's purpose.

### 4.5 Candidate Validation

For every candidate `<CAND_OWNER>/<CAND_REPO>` returned by §4.1–§4.3, confirm that the recorded SHA is reachable:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" -H "Authorization: Bearer $GH_TOKEN" \
    "https://api.github.com/repos/<CAND_OWNER>/<CAND_REPO>/commits/<RECORDED_SHA>"
```

- `200` ⇒ the SHA exists in that repo; it is a valid recovery source.
- `404` ⇒ the SHA is not reachable from that repo's refs; the candidate is a false positive.
- `422` ⇒ the SHA is malformed; re-extract from §2 step 2.

## 5. Verdict Matrix

The agent MUST produce a verdict from the table below before recommending any next step. Any cell marked **HALT**
requires explicit user authorization to proceed.

| Upstream Probe | Local `.git/modules/<PATH>` | Fork/Mirror with SHA | Verdict | Recommended Next Skill |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Alive (2xx) | irrelevant | irrelevant | **Healthy** — no action. | None. |
| Renamed (3xx → new URL) | irrelevant | irrelevant | **Re-point.** | [`git-submodule-fork-reconfigure`](../git-submodule-fork-reconfigure/SKILL.md) |
| Dead (404/410) | Present + SHA reachable locally | irrelevant | **Recoverable from local clone.** Push to a new origin, then re-point. | [`git-submodule-fork-reconfigure`](../git-submodule-fork-reconfigure/SKILL.md) |
| Dead (404/410) | Absent | ≥1 candidate validates (§4.5 = 200) | **Recoverable from public fork.** Re-point `.gitmodules` to the candidate. | [`git-submodule-fork-reconfigure`](../git-submodule-fork-reconfigure/SKILL.md) |
| Dead (404/410) | Absent | None validate | **Unrecoverable.** Recommend removal. | [`git-submodule-removal`](../git-submodule-removal/SKILL.md) (HALT for confirmation) |
| Private (401/404) | irrelevant | irrelevant | **Inaccessible.** Ask the user whether they hold credentials before deciding. | HALT |

***

## 6. Audit Report Template

The agent MUST present the verdict to the user using this exact structure (markdown table, not prose):

```markdown
**Submodule:** `<PATH>`
**Configured URL:** `<URL>`
**Recorded SHA:** `<RECORDED_SHA>`

| Probe | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| Upstream HTML | <2xx | 3xx → <new-url> | 404 | 410> |
| Upstream API  | <Not Found | <full_name>> |
| Local `<PATH>/` | <empty | populated> |
| Local `.git/modules/<PATH>` | <missing | present (size)> |
| SHA reachable locally | <yes | no | n/a> |
| Code search hits for SHA | <count> |
| Validated forks (§4.5 = 200) | <list or none> |
| Wayback snapshot | <yes (date) | none> |

**Verdict:** <one of the §5 verdicts>
**Recommended next skill:** <link>
```

***

## 7. Operational Safety

- **Token Hygiene**: The agent MUST NEVER print the full token, log it, or commit any file containing it. Only the
  prefix may be displayed for verification.
- **Read-Only by Default**: This skill performs zero write operations on the parent repository, the submodule, or
  any remote. It produces a report and a recommendation only.
- **No Auto-Removal**: Even when the verdict is **Unrecoverable**, the agent MUST HALT and request explicit user
  confirmation before invoking the removal skill.
- **Rate-Limit Awareness**: Authenticated GitHub API allows 5,000 req/h; code search allows 30 req/min. The agent
  MUST batch queries and respect `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers when auditing many submodules.
