# Documentation Refinement & Protocol Alignment Walkthrough

I have successfully finalized the separation of **Agent Skills** from **Industrial Rules** and achieved 100%
lint compliance by aligning with the **"Project Root Execution"** mandate and the **"Auto-Fix Mandate"**.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Structural Separation (Skills vs. Rules)

I updated `sync-rules.py` and the documentation templates to create dedicated sections for Skills (stored in
`.agent/skills/`) and Rules.

- **[README.md](../../ai-agent-rules/README.md)** now features a dedicated `Agent Skills` section.
- **[agent-rules.md](../../ai-agent-rules/agent-rules.md)** provides a flat index of both Skills and Rules.

### 2. Linting Resolution & Auto-Fix Protocol

- **MD013 (Line Length)**: Resolved violations in `README.md.template` and session artifacts by using
  `markdownlint-cli2 --fix` strictly from the project root. This autonomously enforced the 120-character limit
  configured in `.markdownlint.jsonc`.
- **MD033 (Inline HTML)**: Fixed alignment formatting in the README footer to comply with industrial standards.
- **Header De-duplication**: Removed redundant "Agent Skills" headers that were introduced during iterative drafting.

### 3. Supreme Literal Continuity Audit (v22)

Successfully performed a supreme audit to restore all truncated or dropped context, including:

- **Change History**: 22 version trace of the implementation plan.
- **User Q&As**: 13 exhaustive entries preserving all corrective feedback.
- **Status Traceability**: Marked all iterative steps as `[DONE] [TIMESTAMP]`.

## Verification Results

### Automated Linting

Executed from the project root (`/Users/dk/Lab_Data/ai-agents/`):

```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/markdownlint-cli2 --fix ai-agent-rules/README.md ai-agent-rules/agent-rules.md ai-agent-rules/docs/**/* ai-agent-rules/conversations/*
```

**Result**: `Summary: 0 error(s)` ✅

### Documentation Generation

Verification of `sync-rules.py` execution:
**Result**: `✅ All files validated successfully. 📄 Generated README.md 📄 Generated agent-rules.md` ✅

## Final Status Traceability

All tasks in `task.md` have been completed according to the industrial standards defined in the project rules.
This session confirms 100% compliance with the **"Industrial Documentation Protocol"**.
